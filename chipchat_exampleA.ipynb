            "   - `bcd_hundreds` is calculated by dividing the binary input by 100 and taking the remainder when divided by 10.\n",
            "   - `bcd_tens` is calculated by dividing the binary input by 10 and taking the remainder when divided by 10.\n",
            "   - `bcd_ones` is simply the remainder of the binary input when divided by 10.\n",
